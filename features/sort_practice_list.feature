Feature: display list of practice problems sorted by different topics

  As a berkeley cs student
  So that I can quickly browse problems based on my preferences
  I want to see practice problems sorted by difficulty or type

Background: practice problems have been added to database

Scenario: sort problems in order increasing difficulty

Scenario: sort problems alphabetically
