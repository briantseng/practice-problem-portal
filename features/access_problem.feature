Feature: access practice problems

  As a student of UC Berkeley
  So I can improve my grades
  I can access practice problems

Background:

  Given the following practice problems exist:

  | title         | category               |  difficulty | description |
  | 'Baby'        | 'lists', 'strings'     | 'average'   | yes         |
  | 'Filter Tree' | 'trees', 'recursion'   | 'average'   | no          |
  | 'Contains'    | 'trees', 'recursion'   | 'basic'     | yes         |
  | 'Over Nine'   | 'trees'                | 'basic'     | no          |
  | 'Numbers'     | 'control', 'recursion' | 'advanced'  | no          |
